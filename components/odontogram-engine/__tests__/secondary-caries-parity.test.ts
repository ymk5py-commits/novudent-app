// SP6 Task 1: caries is a per-surface STATE MACHINE (corrects the SP5 model).
// A caried surface is exactly ONE of:
//   - PRIMARY caries   (no filling on the surface) → `caries-{surface}` at the
//     ICDAS depth tier (opacity 0.45 / 0.7 / 1 + `caries-deep`), or
//   - RECURRENT caries (a filling on the same surface) → `subcaries-{surface}`
//     at the CARS opacity `0.30 + (sev-1)/5 * 0.70` (the primary layer is NOT
//     activated).
// Recurrence is DERIVED from the filling — never an independent stored flag — so
// a surface is NEVER both `caries-X` and `subcaries-X`. The single unified
// `cariesSeverity` score (default 2) is read as ICDAS on a primary surface and
// as CARS on a recurrent one, and it carries UNCHANGED across the transition.
