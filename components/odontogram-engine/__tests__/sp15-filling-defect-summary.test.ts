// SP15 Task 5 (B3): "If a filling has a defect, it should appear at the bottom
// as text the same way secondary caries does." Secondary caries is folded
// into the whole-mouth Caries line with an explicit qualifier word
// ("D - secondary"). Investigation (see task-5-report.md) showed the filling
// defect DID already surface on the whole-mouth Fillings line, but only as a
// bare "surface: defectType" suffix with no labeling word — unlike secondary
// caries, which always names itself via `toothInfo.secondary`. The fix adds
// the existing `fillingDefect.label` i18n key to the suffix so the whole-mouth
// text reads as clearly/explicitly as the secondary-caries entry.
