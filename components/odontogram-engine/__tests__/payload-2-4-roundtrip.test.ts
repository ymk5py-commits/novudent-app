// SP6 Task 1: payload version 2.4 — the SP5 `cariesDepths` (ICDAS) +
// `secondaryCaries` (CARS) pair was unified into a single per-surface
// `cariesSeverity` (0..6), read as ICDAS on a primary surface and CARS on a
// recurrent (filled) one. This task bumps the export/parse version tag to 2.4
// and proves the round-trip of the unified field alongside the unchanged
// `rootCaries` / `radiographicDepth`.
//
// `importStatus`/`hydrateState` are field-presence-driven and only branch on
// `payload.version` for the version-gated legacy inference (see
// sp5-final-fixes.test.ts) — the tag is otherwise informational. Exercised via
// `__setToothStateForTest`, the exact per-tooth `hydrateState(raw)` call
// `importStatus` makes, without a live DOM/SVG grid.
